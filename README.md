#SmpMath-David Angelo


I am going to be making a simple mathematics app that solves simple equations of user input.
I’ll have a gui of simple user inputs and actions. An output and hopefully simple algebra/calculus/algorithms for solving simple math problems. 


First, I’ll make the ui.
Then, I’ll make the execution of math.
- glorified calculator
 
Then, I’ll make math objects (vars, calc operators, etc)
- basic equation trees
- algebra
- simple built in functions
- calc rules
- algorithms
- solve equation trees
I’ll make the output ui.
Finally, I’ll pretty it up.
If I have time. I’ll make it complex number friendly.

I might do substantially less though.

I want to make something complicated enough to solve kind of difficult problems,
but not complicated enough that the user could input something that can’t be solved.
For example. There will only be one available variable and 4 operations and their inverses excluding integration.

It will solve polynomials numerically.
